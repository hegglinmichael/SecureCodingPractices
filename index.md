title: "Copy and Paste Examples For Secure Coding"
---

Welcome! Whether you're looking for a secure coding example, or just here because this was a link on google, I'm here to help!

This is a very simple blog! I'm not a front end developer;) PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I POSTED SOMETHING INSECURE!  I don't know everything. 

1. Command+F on mac(or Control+F on Windows)
2. Enter your programming language, then the topic you would like written with spaces all words Capitalized
      Example: C++ Executing Shell Commands

List of Languages and Topics supported to make searching easier!

| Languages | 
| --------- |  
| C++ |         
| Python |

| Topics |
| ------ |
| Executing Shell Commands |

THESE ARE SIMPLY EXAMPLES!!! They may not be the best way to do things, but are probably better than what you'd find on stackoverflow. I am not liable for any security problems you or your company has. This is purely for academic research!
